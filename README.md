# Depth-Rate

3) My Answers to the following questions:
a) Describe a way to optimize the solution for heavy traffic :
=> To optimize for heavy traffic, we can consider implementing caching mechanisms, such as Redis, to store previously calculated depth rates for specific date ranges. 
   Additionally, we can scale our Node.js application horizontally by deploying it on multiple servers behind a load balancer.

c) What other metrics can we calculate from this database :
=> From the given database, we can calculate various other metrics, including:

*)Engagement Rate: Calculate the percentage of users who triggered events compared to the total number of visits.
*)Average Session Duration: Calculate the average time users spent on the website during their visits.
*)Bounce Rate: Calculate the percentage of users who left the website after viewing only one page.
*)Conversion Rate: Calculate the percentage of users who completed a specific action or conversion goal.
*)Event Type Distribution: Analyze the distribution of scroll events vs. duration events over time.
*)User Behavior Segmentation: Segment users based on their event interactions and analyze their behavior separately.
